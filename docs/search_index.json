["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Our world is awash with data. This book will explore ways of thinking about data and technologies that implement these ideas for importing, manuplulating, and structuring data. This book focuses on tools in the R programming language, and it is assumed that you’re already familiar with the basics of R. If you’re new to R I highly suggest getting started with R Programming for Data Science by Roger Peng or with Swirl for a more interactive approach.
