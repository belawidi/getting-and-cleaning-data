# Introduction {-}

Our world is awash with data. This book will explore ways of thinking about
data and technologies that implement these ideas for importing, manuplulating,
and structuring data.

This book focuses on tools in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/),
and it is assumed that you're already familiar with the basics of R. If you're
new to R I highly suggest getting started with
[R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) by
[Roger Peng](https://twitter.com/rdpeng) or with [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/)
for a more interactive approach. If you're interested in a thorough treatment
of advanced topics in R programming I recommend
[Mastering Software Development in R](https://leanpub.com/msdr) by Roger Peng,
[Brooke Anderson](https://twitter.com/gbwanderson), and
[me](https://twitter.com/seankross).
